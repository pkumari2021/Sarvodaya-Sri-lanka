<div><h2>History</h2><hr>
	<font size="4">Beginning in just one village and extending the movement to service a total 
	of more than 15,000 villages over the past 50+ years has been a fascinating adventure. 
 <br><br>Initially it involved an education program that aimed at enabling students and teachers to live and work with the most 
 remote village communities in Sri Lanka, lending a hand and developing self-help initiatives. Within nine years the “service
 learning programme” had expanded into a full-fledged development movement in hundreds of villages, with the goal of a 
 comprehensive and nonviolent social transformation. During its first 15 years, Sarvodaya grew with hardly any foreign aid or
 state support, relying on volunteer labour, mostly from the beneficiaries themselves.
 <br><br>By the late 1970s, the Sarvodaya Movement, with support from partner organisations in more prosperous countries,
 became capable of reaching nearly every part of Sri Lanka. The programme of self-reliance, community participation and a holistic
 approach to community “awakening” appealed not only to people in poor communities, but also to donors. Thousands of young men and
 women learned how to motivate and organise people in their own villages to meet the ten basic human needs, ranging from a clean
 and adequate drinking-water supply to simple housing and sanitation, communications facilities, energy supplies, education and ways
 of satisfying spiritual and cultural needs. During its first three decades, the Sarvodaya Movement was able – initially without any
 assistance, and later within a framework of development cooperation with like-minded organisations – to become one of the largest 
 participatory organisations in the region.
 The momentum of the movement was such that 
<br><br>by the early 1990s, in spite of harassment by the government and political violence, Sarvodaya had achieved an enormous outreach.
 The movement’s work now included peace building, conflict resolution, appropriate technology and programmes for children at risk, elders
 and those with disabilities all the while focusing on a holistic approach to social mobilisation through empowerment of people beyond
 mere economic development.
 At around the same time, international priorities changed, switching to economic development strategies. Large projects 
 and macro-interventions began to dominate the scene amongst donors, and Sarvodaya, which had originally attracted attention due 
 to its broader based philosophy, became the victim of its own success. 
<br><br>In 1991, when 85% of its external aid dried up, the movement was forced to go back to its roots. From then on, we relied
 on our early pioneer villages to provide support for the surrounding communities still requiring development. In addition, we reduced 
 the numbers of paid staff and counted on the commitment of Sarvodaya’s long-term supporters to keep the movement on course.
The Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement has now become stronger than ever before. A new administrative management at national level is 
supporting a motivated group of emerging leaders at the village and district levels. Although almost one-third of the districts
 supported by Sarvodaya are not financed by outside partners, they are nevertheless surviving in the knowledge that in the long term,
  progress for them will result from partnership and self-sustaining development activities rather than from charity. Our important role 
  in peacemaking, community building, and securing a certain quality of life in Sri Lanka is undiminished, and our will to achieve 
  innovation in the social, ethical, cultural, spiritual and economic fields is constantly nourished by partners who have the confidence 
  that our 50+ years of experience – including periods of hardship – have timeless value.

<font size="4">Born November 5, 1931, Dr. Ahangamage Tudor Ariyaratne is the founder of the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement 
of Sri Lanka. A former high school teacher at Nalanda College, he conducted the first 
shramadana work camp in 1958, which eventually lead to the establishment of the largest non-government organization in the country. 
The father of six distinguished adult children, he has led tens of thousands of “family gatherings” and meditations with millions of 
people throughout Sri Lanka and other parts of the world.

	<h2>Organizational Structure</h2><hr>
<div width="100%"><img src="images/structure.jpg"></div><br><br>
<font size="4">The Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement of Sri Lanka consists of the main  incorporated body, 
	officially known as Lanka Jathika Sarvodaya Shramadana Sangamaya, a family of legally Independent units catering to
	specific fields of development activities, and the village level Sarvodaya Shramadana Societies (SSSs). In each SSS there
	are child members (aged 7-14), youth members (14-25), ordinary members (over 25 years), life members, and invited members
	(honorary members). From this is drawn a executive council of 25 members; 18 executive members (3 children, 3 youth, 3 mothers 
	and 9 ordinary members) and 7 elders (selected from life & ordinary members). Sub-committees help to fulfill the needs of the village.
